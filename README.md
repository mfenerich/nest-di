![NestJS Logo](https://nestjs.com/img/logo_text.svg)

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial series on Dependency Injection in NestJS, exploring concepts from basic to advanced techniques through practical examples.

## üìö Articles

### 1. Understanding Dependency Injection in NestJS: A Practical Guide

**Description:** Learn the fundamentals of Dependency Injection in NestJS through a practical example modeling computer components. This introductory guide covers what DI is, why it matters, and how to implement your first module with proper dependency management.

**Tags:** [NestJS, DependencyInjection, WebDevelopment, TypeScript, Modules, Backend, NodeJS, BeginnerTutorial, SoftwareArchitecture, ModularDesign]

### 2. Dependency Injection in NestJS: Cross-Module Services

**Description:** Dive deeper into sharing services across modules in NestJS as we implement CPU and Disk modules that depend on a common Power service. Master the three-step process for cross-module dependencies and understand how NestJS resolves the dependency tree.

**Tags:** [NestJS, CrossModuleServices, TypeScript, ModuleHierarchy, DependencyInjection, BackendDevelopment, NodeJS, IntermediateTutorial, ServiceInjection, ApplicationDesign]

### 3. Advanced Dependency Injection in NestJS: Beyond the Basics

**Description:** Explore advanced Dependency Injection concepts in NestJS including custom providers, scoped instances, dynamic modules, and testing strategies. Learn professional patterns for building flexible, maintainable applications with sophisticated dependency management.

**Tags:** [NestJS, AdvancedDependencyInjection, CustomProviders, DynamicModules, Testing, TypeScript, SoftwareArchitecture, EnterprisePatterns, BestPractices, AdvancedTutorial]
